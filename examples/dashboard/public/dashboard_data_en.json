By comparison, peers (Daeyang Paper 3.88x, SamBo Paper 2.66x) have notably lower multiples, yet earnings deteriorated in H1 2025 (operating profit down 23%, net income down 52.6%). PBR 0.63x is fair, but a profitability-less PER premium is prone to adjustment. Valuation attractiveness relative to peers in the same industry is markedly low.",
      "sector_outlook": "The corrugated/packaging sector is steady on e-commerce demand but growth is slowing. Domestic large players’ higher output sustains oversupply pressure; volatility in raw materials (recycled paper, pulp) and difficulty passing through costs limit profitability improvements. Printing/newspaper paper is structurally shrinking. Industry-wide shift toward cost-management-driven leadership; short-term earnings momentum is hard to expect. Long-term stability but lacking growth drivers.",
      "market_condition": "KOSPI reached a record high (4,221.87) with RSI 76 in overbought territory. Strong short-term upside momentum but increasing pullback risk. Foreign and institutional net buying continues, but individuals are beginning to take profits on a large scale. Short-term volatility expanding.",
      "rationale": "1) PER 14.12x is 2–3x above the industry average; ongoing earnings deterioration (-23%, -52.6%) adds pressure for valuation adjustment. 2) After a short rally (+20%), there is limited upside beyond the 13,500 won resistance; high risk in chasing highs. 3) Industry outlook is limited (oversupply, cost pressures) with no clear earnings-recovery momentum. Compared with undervalued peers (Daeyang Paper, SamBo Paper), investment appeal is low."
